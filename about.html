        My name is Frank Sommers. I am a native San Franciscan currently in school to become a web developer. I graduated from Boston University in 2012 with a BA in International Relations. While in college I began to pursue my childhood dream of becoming an Officer of Marines and a Pilot. Upon graduation I was supposed to attend the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico VA, but due to downsizing and government shutdowns the process was prolonged for three years. I was told that I would be shipping to training in approximately six months so I chose to pursue employment in a field truly inline with my interests. From a young age I have been passionate about everything aviation related as well as remote controlled. Although I did not have a technical degree I saw the six months of waiting for the Marine Corps as an opportunity to explore my interests instead. I interviewed at AeriCam, a local drone startup. At the time AeriCam was a one man operation. I started at AeriCam assembling and testing drones, and within six months I was made VP and partner. During this period my technical skills grew beyond my direct interest in drones. I acquired skills in 3D design, cnc machining, marketing, basic web design, operations management, and networking. Most importantly, my experience at AeriCam demonstrated that I was capable reaching beyond what I believed my college degree limited me to. I chose to pursue an education in web development both because of my interest in it and with hopes that it will open doors for me in the drone and robotics industries.
